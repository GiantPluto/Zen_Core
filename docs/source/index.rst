Zen Core C++ Library documentation
==================================

Zen Core is the foundation of the rest of Zen Open Source Software (ZOSS).

It is written in pure ISO C++ and relies only on [http://www.boost.org Boost], and [http://xmlsoft.org/ libxml2] libraries.

It contains a smart pointer memory management library, a template based event library, a math library, a plugin system, a scripting framework, a threading library and a utility library.
